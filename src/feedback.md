# Feedback encouraged

I would love to get feedback on what you see here. I am quite sure that I have overlooked a lot of things that are taking place in Rust land. I would also like to start expanding the tree into other domains, like embedded Rust, with which I am personally less familiar. Feel free to open issues or PRs on this repository -- or, if you have a larger set of ideas, perhaps to make a fork of this repository! (see below)
