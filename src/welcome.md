# Welcome

## Goal

This repository is an attempt to wrap my brain around the "state of Rust". It consists of various interlinked [skill trees] -- I recommend you start with the [main tree] to get the overall view. From there you should be able to click on many of the items to get more details.

[skill trees]: https://github.com/nikomatsakis/skill-tree
[main tree]: ./main.md

At the moment, this repository is very much an experiment. My hope though is that it will become a useful tool for communicating about the state of Rust and for describing a particular vision for how Rust should evolve. For example, when I meet with folks, I hope to show them this document and get their feedback on what is mising. I hope that others may read it and be encouraged to close some of the gaps or contribute to ongoing efforts.

## Warning: Work in progress

This repository is an **unofficial work-in-progress**. Do not interpret what you see here as "the plan" for Rust or anything like that. The goal here is very much for me to clarify my own thinking. I don't really expect this repository to ever be "done" -- plans are always changing as the world evolves.
