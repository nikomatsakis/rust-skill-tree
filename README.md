# Rust skill tree

## Goal

This repository is an attempt to wrap my brain around the "state of Rust". It consists of various interlinked [skill trees] -- I recommend you start with [`main.svg`] to get the overall view. From there you should be able to click on many of the items to get more details.

[skill trees]: https://github.com/nikomatsakis/skill-tree
[`main.svg`]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikomatsakis/rust-skill-tree/main/skill-trees/main.svg

At the moment, this repository is very much an experiment. My hope though is that it will become a useful tool for communicating about the state of Rust and for describing a particular vision for how Rust should evolve. For example, when I meet with folks, I hope to show them this document and get their feedback on what is mising. I hope that others may read it and be encouraged to close some of the gaps or contribute to ongoing efforts.

## Warning: Work in progress

This repository is an **unofficial work-in-progress**. Do not interpret what you see here as "the plan" for Rust or anything like that. The goal here is very much for me to clarify my own thinking. I don't really expect this repository to ever be "done" -- plans are always changing as the world evolves.

## Feedback encouraged

I would love to get feedback on what you see here. I am quite sure that I have overlooked a lot of things that are taking place in Rust land. I would also like to start expanding the tree into other domains, like embedded Rust, with which I am personally less familiar. Feel free to open issues or PRs on this repository -- or, if you have a larger set of ideas, perhaps to make a fork of this repository! (see below)

## Forks welcome

That said, in a language and environment as complex as Rust, there will never be a single vision that captures everything. I would love to see others drafting their own forks of this skill tree that focus on a different angle. If you do take a stab at your own tree, feel free to open a PR and link to it here.
