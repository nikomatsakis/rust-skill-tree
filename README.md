# Rust skill tree

## Goal

This repository is an attempt to wrap my brain around the "state of Rust". It consists of various interlinked [skill trees]. You can [read about them here][here]. 

[skill trees]: https://github.com/nikomatsakis/skill-tree
[here]: https://nikomatsakis.github.io/rust-skill-tree

## Warning: Work in progress

At the moment, this repository is **very much an experiment**. Do not interpret what you see here as "the plan" for Rust or anything like that. The goal both to clarify my own thinking and to have a tool for communicating that thinking to others and getting feedback. I welcome [feedback] and also would love to see others [create their own skill trees][fork].
